#Blogpost 3: New text editor in VM
##by austin
###Comparing
###Normal basic text editor

A normal text editor does nothing interesting other then do exactly what  
you tell it

###other editors ive used in the past
###IDLE

I have used Idle which was for python and it did not help much but  
it was pretty and i could customise it, it also did a few things other than  
normal like printing breaks. It could possibly do cool things but i don't  
know how nor have i been taught it. 

Its also free

###vb

VB was a cool aplication because its tailored to the coding landuage  
i can find all the possible code and it will tell me how i can use it  
and it will also debug it as well. A pretty amazing tool because it knows  
what your coding and will help you. it seems to only work for a certain kind  
of code though

also free (C, and VB)

###Subline compared to other things

I have seen on the internets where i have downloaded i from that  
it can do some cool things like having multiple cursors that you can use  
to select and type many things. it also has a minimap to locate a specific region on my code.

It seems pretty good for general code editing on general code types. (apparently you  
also have to pay for it as well though the trial is untimed.)

###overall

VB seems pretty good for its language and IDLE seems good for its language tough  
only prettily, and Subline seems great in general if you want to buy it to get a "legal" copy.
