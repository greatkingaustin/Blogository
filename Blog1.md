#Blog post 1:problems and laziness

###solving problems

Problems are annoying but fun to solve, to solve a problem  
one just subdivide the problem in to smaller problems and  
sort them out then repeat the process.

Task so far:

 * subdivide the problem into smaller problems
 * sort the problems out
 * repeat

When the problems are small enough it becomes easy to  
solve them and you know how to solve them without getting  
lost in the many other problems that the main one was  
entangled in.

###being lazy

the thing about solving problems is that you need to be  
lazy, it saves time and makes things simple.

you don't need to solve a problem that someone else has  
probably already, solved you can cheat and use their method.  
getting other people to help you with their specialisation can  
also help you and save time.

That is all.
